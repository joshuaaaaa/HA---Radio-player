## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Card doesn't appear

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify resource is added to configuration.yaml
4. Restart Home Assistant

### No stations in playlist

1. Make sure **Radio Browser integration** is installed
2. **Select a media player** from the dropdown
3. Wait for stations to load (may take a few seconds)
4. Check browser console for errors

### Stations don't play

1. Verify your media player supports URL streaming
2. Test the media player with another source
3. Try a different station
4. Check Home Assistant logs for errors

### YouTube doesn't play

1. **Check media player compatibility** - YouTube requires VLC/Kodi/Plex/Cast
2. **NOT compatible** with browser_mod or simple audio players
3. Card will warn you if player doesn't support YouTube
4. Try with VLC media player (most reliable)
5. Check Home Assistant logs for YouTube-related errors

### Local MP3 doesn't play

1. **Check file format** - must be valid MP3 file
2. **Browser compatibility** - works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
3. **File size** - very large files may cause browser issues
4. **Clear browser cache** if file doesn't load
5. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
6. Try with a smaller MP3 file first

### Custom stream doesn't play

1. **Verify stream URL** - must be direct HTTP/HTTPS audio URL
2. **Check CORS** - stream must allow browser access
3. **Try in browser** - paste URL directly in browser to test
4. **Check format** - MP3 streams work best
5. Some streams may require authentication

### Can't delete custom station

1. **Look for trash icon** (🗑️) - only visible on custom stations
2. **Not visible** on radio browser stations (they can't be deleted)
3. **Refresh page** if button doesn't respond
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## 📚 Technical Details

### How It Works

**Loading Stations:**
- Uses Home Assistant's Radio Browser integration
- Browses stations by country to optimize loading
- Displays filtered stations in the playlist

**Radio Station Playback:**
```javascript
hass.callService('media_player', 'play_media', {
  entity_id: 'media_player.speaker',
  media_content_id: 'media-source://radio_browser/[uuid]',
  media_content_type: 'audio/mpeg'
})
```

**YouTube Playback:**
```javascript
// Sent to Home Assistant media player (VLC/Kodi/Plex required)
hass.callService('media_player', 'play_media', {
  entity_id: 'media_player.vlc',
  media_content_id: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID',
  media_content_type: 'music'
})
```

**Local MP3 & Custom Streams:**
```javascript
// Direct browser playback using HTML5 Audio element
const audio = document.createElement('audio');
audio.src = 'data:audio/mpeg;base64,BASE64_DATA'; // For MP3 files
// OR
audio.src = 'https://stream.example.com/radio.mp3'; // For custom streams
audio.play();
```

**Data Storage:**
- **Primary**: Browser localStorage (fast, instant access)
- **Auto-backup**: HA server via `frontend/set_user_data` (survives cache clear)
- **Manual backup**: JSON file export/import (for transfers between installations)
- **MP3 Files**: Converted to base64 data URLs using FileReader API
- **Custom Stations**: Saved as JSON in localStorage + HA server
- **Station Format**:
```javascript
{
  title: "My Song",
  media_content_id: "data:audio/mpeg;base64,//uQx...",
  media_content_type: "audio/mpeg",
  source: "local_mp3",
  fileName: "song.mp3"
}
```
- **Backup JSON Format (v2.0)**:
```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "exported": "2026-02-08T12:00:00.000Z",
  "favorites": [...],
  "custom_stations": [...]
}
```
